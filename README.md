# Race Bar Charts

## Introduction

> I'm going to play around with a chart type that has become quite popular in recent months, which is these Race Style charts. Its an excellent way to show trends and changes over time, and looks great when shared as a video. Having a visualisation in a video format really allows for greater sharing and accessibility.

## Demo

> My first demo is looking at the Global Causes of Death from 1990 - 2017 and [can be found here](https://observablehq.com/@selfrefute/global-causes-of-death-1990-2017). The data was sourced from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease (GBD)
